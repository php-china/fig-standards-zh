PHP 框架协作组
====================================

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the
commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main
audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community
is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to
do so, but that is not the aim.

提议标准规范流程
------------------------------------

如果打算提议一个PHP标准规范(PSR)

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the PSR in
  `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; 或者

- 在邮件列表中发起讨论

[邮件列表]: http://groups.google.com/group/php-fig/

Github的用途
------------

所有关于PSR的讨论都是通过邮件列表来完成的，在Github上的Issues很少被光顾，所以很容易被忽略掉，建议通过邮件列表
来发表讨论。
Reviews of a proposed PSR should be
conducted on the mailing list, not through PR comments for the same reason.

Please do not simply file an issue or PR and walk-away.  The most likely outcome
is that it will never get seen or addressed.

Requesting Membership
---------------------

You **do not** need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on
the [mailing list][].

To become a voting member, you must send an email to the [mailing list][].

- The subject line should read: `Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})`

- The body should include your name, the name of (and link to) the project you
  represent, and other details you feel are relevant.

- Current members will vote on your request.

Do not combine separate membership requests in a single thread; one request
per thread, please.

语言与翻译
-----------------------

所有的PSR都是使用英文来编写的。PHP FIG没有提供其他语言的官方翻译版本，欢迎对此有兴趣的人将PSR翻译为其他语言。

Voting Members
--------------

The current list of voting members is available on the [project website][].
